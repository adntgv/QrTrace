# QrTrace — Marketing Plan

## Positioning
**Tagline**: "QR codes that adapt and track"
**Value Prop**: Create dynamic QR codes where you can change the destination anytime + get full scan analytics

## Target Segments

### 1. Restaurants & Cafes (Primary)
- Pain: Menu QR codes become outdated, need reprinting
- Solution: Update menu URL without touching the physical QR
- Channel: Google Ads ("restaurant QR code menu"), local SEO, food industry forums
- Price sensitivity: Low — $9/mo is nothing for a restaurant

### 2. Digital Marketers (Primary)
- Pain: No analytics on QR code scans, can't A/B test
- Solution: Per-QR analytics dashboard, changeable destinations
- Channel: Twitter/X, Product Hunt, marketing subreddits, LinkedIn
- Price sensitivity: Medium — need to see ROI

### 3. Event Organizers (Secondary)
- Pain: Event details change, printed QR codes are static
- Solution: Dynamic redirect, toggle active/inactive
- Channel: Event planning communities, Eventbrite integrations
- Price sensitivity: Low — per-event cost is minimal

### 4. Small Business Owners (Secondary)
- Pain: Want to track engagement from business cards, flyers
- Solution: Simple QR creation + basic analytics
- Channel: SMB forums, Yelp ads, local business groups
- Price sensitivity: Medium
